# Introduction
This project is aimed to show what I have learnt in this term.
Generally speaking I am more interested in creating scene with small patterns.
I feel like that what we have learnt each week are all so important that can not be ignored.
So let us see what I have done.

# Part One
This scene is about the shinning and flashing stars.
I have tried to use it to express the scenery of time traveling(I hope so).

# Part Two
So this part's name is Galaxy.
To describe when we are at the center of the galaxy, what can we see ?
I used the function of trigonometry and the angles to control the points.

# Part Three
