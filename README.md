# Project Theme 
  Dynamic and interactive scene about Interstellar Travel created by JavaScript.

# Introduction
  This project is aimed to show what I have learnt in this term.
  Generally speaking I am more interested in creating scene with small patterns.
  I feel like that what we have learnt each week are all so important that can not be ignored.
Both the 3d model setting and the logical operation of coordinates can be used to create what we want to express.
  So let us see what I have done.

# Part One
  This scene is about the shinning and flashing stars.
  It is worth mentioning that in this project, I applied the knowledge of shader and drew on the writing methods of some mature schemes to finally get the rendered star effect.
  I have tried to use it to express the scenery of time traveling(I hope so).

# Part Two
  So this part's name is Galaxy.
  To describe when we are at the center of the galaxy, what can we see ?
  I used the function of trigonometry and the angles to control the points.
  Also, I let the color parameter changes as the number of cycles increases.
  The patterns appear random, but in fact there is a certain pattern.

# Part Three
  I used some simple nesting of for functions and if functions, plus some use of random to construct a flowing futuristic river effect. And I also used the even-listener of the mouse and the keyboard make it accessible for users to control the scene by interactions from the input of computers.

# Part Four
  This part of job is called blue rose.
  I used simple lines-change to create the flower frame and it can keep changing for long time.
  This is my favorite part. Basically I only used the knowledge of the basic course like control the points and then draw lines, but what excited me most is that I really wanted to say the story of little prince at first, but actually I found it so hard to use the JavaScript to creative a real world, I didnâ€™t reach a satisfying effect. But I can still create something I like by the ways I am good at, So that is exactly where my inspiration comes from.

# Conclusion
  Actually what I want to show is the experience of human beings travel through time and space then come into a totally new galaxy, We found different environment and new ecology. They are all so breathtakingly beautiful, and finally we found our own rose at our own planet, just like the little prince story. I always thought the universe was powerful and untouchable, but it was fascinating. We may be alone at this moment, but I hope that one day we will all find our rose somewhere in the vast universe.
  And last but not least, I will keep going with what I have learnt and seen. Thanks for every person who have helped me with my work during this term.
