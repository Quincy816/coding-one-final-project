# Introduction
  This project is aimed to show what I have learnt in this term.
  Generally speaking I am more interested in creating scene with small patterns.
  I feel like that what we have learnt each week are all so important that can not be ignored.
  So let us see what I have done.

# Part One
  This scene is about the shinning and flashing stars.
  I have tried to use it to express the scenery of time traveling(I hope so).

# Part Two
  So this part's name is Galaxy.
  To describe when we are at the center of the galaxy, what can we see ?
  I used the function of trigonometry and the angles to control the points.

# Part Three
  I used some simple nesting of for functions and if functions, plus some use of random to construct a flowing futuristic river effect.

# Part Four
  This part called bluerose.
I used simple lines changes to create the flower frame and it can change for long time.

# Conclusion
  Actually what I want to show is the experience of humanbeings travel through time and then come into a totally new galaxy, We found different environment and new ecology. They are all so breathtakingly beautiful, and finally we found our own rose at our own planet, just like the little prince story.
